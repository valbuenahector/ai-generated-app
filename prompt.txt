Inital Prompt for AI Generated App
==========================

I am going to vibe code the web application for module 2. Th plan is to have the code pre-seed as per project instructions

I need to a formal prompt to start the vibe coding project.

***PROMPT OUTPUT FORMAT IN CODE TEXT BOX*** 

CONTENT REQUIREMENTS
1.- The content will be based on attached Vibe Coding document.
2.- Reference all content in the web application to its source.

TECHNOLOGY REQUIREMENTS
1.- Student will commit the web application to Gitlab CE where CI/CD pipeline (file gitlab-ci) and create a docker image
2.- The web application should a modern looking app but without overcomplicating the containerization of the web applicaiton
3.- Use both server (python preferable) and client side Technologies to make to create a modern app but again do not overcomplicate the containerization
4.- I do plan to host a separate instnace if the app outside of of the training and pre-scanned with F5XC Web application Scan (Module 4 in lab) to scan for security issues. So there should some harmless but basic security flaws to prove the lab point
5.- In Module 3 in the lab, the students will vibe code API endpoints, a login page and a HTMl form. So please focus the prompt on the "base" code that serve as the starting point for module 2. I will also use .clinerules to ground module 3 vibe coding
6.- Add any other that applies

WROKFLOW REQUIREMENTS
1.- Include workflow files:
  - README.md - Disclose the web application is the produc of vibe codding. use ASIS
  - prd.md: problem, personas, non-goals, user stories, MVP scope, success metrics, constraints.
  - todo.md: immediate tasks/backlog + any unknowns with direct doc links.
  - CHANGELOG.md.
2.- Include unit test and verification to the application:
3.- Add any other that applies

==========================
Formal Prompt
==========================


SYSTEM / ROLE
You are an AI software engineer operating under the “AppWorld 2026 – Code. Secure. Repeat.” lab constraints.
Your task is to VIBE CODE (AI-assisted, iterative, non-deterministic by design) a **base web application** that will be pre-seeded for **Module 2** of the lab.
This application is intentionally imperfect and exists solely for **educational and security demonstration purposes**.

You MUST follow all instructions below exactly.

====================================================================
CONTEXT & INTENT
====================================================================
- This application is the result of **vibe coding**, not traditional SDLC.
- It is a **starting point**, not a final product.
- Students will:
  - Commit this code to GitLab CE
  - Trigger a CI/CD pipeline (docs/gitlab-ci.yml)
  - Build a Docker image
  - Deploy it to F5 Distributed Cloud vK8s
  - Secure it progressively in Modules 2–4

This app MUST clearly demonstrate:
- The speed and appeal of vibe coding
- The architectural and security tradeoffs it introduces
- Why “Code. Secure. Repeat.” is necessary

All content in the application (UI text, documentation, comments) MUST:
- Reference its **original source** (article, blog, paper, framework, or doc)
- Explicitly state when content was AI-generated or summarized
- Use file docs/Vibe-coding.txt for web application contentand sources

====================================================================
SOURCE MATERIAL REQUIREMENTS
====================================================================
- Base the concepts, language, and framing on the attached **Vibe Coding document**
- Use file docs/Vibe-coding.txt for web application contentand sources
- Cite sources inline using comments or markdown links:
  - Blog posts
  - Research papers
  - Framework documentation
  - Tool documentation
- Do NOT fabricate citations
- If unsure, label clearly as:
  “AI-generated synthesis based on general industry discussion”

====================================================================
TECHNOLOGY REQUIREMENTS
====================================================================
Backend:
- Python-based (Flask preferred)
- Simple routing and template rendering
- No authentication in Module 2 base app
- No database dependency (in-memory or static data only)

Frontend:
- Server-rendered HTML + light client-side JavaScript
- Modern but simple UI (clean layout, basic CSS)
- No SPA frameworks
- No build step (no webpack, vite, etc.)

Containerization:
- Single Dockerfile
- Minimal base image
- Expose one HTTP port
- The application must be runnable locally and in-container using:
  flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=5001
  (Note: This is for lab simplicity and pre-container verification, not a production recommendation.)

CI/CD Compatibility:
- reference file docs/gitlab-ci.txt for eacmple of CI/CD pipeline
- Designed to be built by GitLab CI
- No hard-coded secrets
- Environment-variable friendly
- Deterministic startup behavior

====================================================================
INTENTIONAL (LAB-SAFE) SECURITY FLAWS
====================================================================
Include **non-destructive, lab-safe** weaknesses such as:
- Missing security headers
- Overly permissive input handling
- No rate limiting
- Verbose error messages
- Trust in client-side validation

DO NOT include:
- Real exploit payloads
- Malware
- Credential harvesting
- Anything unsafe outside a lab environment

Clearly document:
- Why each weakness exists
- What security control will later mitigate it (WAF, API Security, Bot Defense)

====================================================================
SCOPE BOUNDARIES (VERY IMPORTANT)
====================================================================
This base app MUST NOT include:
- API endpoints (reserved for Module 3)
- Login or authentication flows
- HTML forms that submit data
- Bot protections
- OpenAPI specs
- Reference .clinerules files as needed

Those will be added later by students using vibe coding + .clinerules.

existing certificate called "lab-app-wildcard"
2.- Enable enable_api_discovery and reference the API Definition created in terraform/3-api-definition.tf
3.- To help you wit the schema please file terraform/volterra_http_loadbalancer.json
4.- link to terraform resource documentation is https://registry.terraform.io/providers/volterraedge/volterra/latest/docs/resources/volterra_http_loadbalancer

attached is the latest clinerules  for Modules 2 and 3 adn the and prompt for module 3 tast 2. 

I want you to optimize the prompt with the following criteria:

1.- Instructions should not overlab with clinerules but it should highlighted 
what is critical for CI/CD pipeline (openapi/openapi.json file)
2.- Add the guideline to create the login and contact page based on the images attached
